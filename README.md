### Hello! 👋
I'm Angeleena a software engineer from the San Francisco Bay Area. I lean more towards the front-end side of engineering, but I am currently reinforcing and strengthening my full-stack skills with my second coding bootcamp at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive-remote-flex">General Assembly.</a>

😁 My preferred pronouns are she/her/hers. </br>
🧠 I am currently learning DOM manipulation and can't wait to learn all about Python. </br>
🧘‍♀️ My free time is mostly spent practing yoga, hanging out with my family, and exploring the coastal trails in my area. </br>
